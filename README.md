# MCM-Experience
Share some personal experience in MCM (The Mathematical Contest in Modeling)

It is basically written for those teams from International Campus, ZJU. It is more like some thoughts rather than "experience."

Recently, I have been asked by many MCM/ICM participants about the experience in MCM 2018. Honestly speaking, I really don't have the so called "experience" you may expect. The most significant "experience" is that I met two nice teammates (Yifan Chen and Enyi Jiang) fortunately. Working as a team is very very important for this competition.

Meritorious winner is really nothing worthy of high appraise. It is not that difficult. Someone said, they are strongly supported by the whole institute to win this prize. It is definitely absurd. I believe there will be more and more meritorious winners, and even outstanding winners from our campus. Taking the advantage of systematically trained essay writing techniques, you are really the next prospective winner. However, it is also not an "arranged" piece of cake. I felt very lucky that our work is acknowledged. However, the final result could not really mean much about the value of your paper. Certainly, I highly appreciate those "Outstanding/Finalist" papers and many unlucky but nice papers. I have met many--like a lot--excellent participants who ended with an unsatisfactory result. Thus, please don't expect too much "fairness" on the results. I think the most precious reward of MCM 2018 for me is not the final prize, but my potential of learning many new knowledge in a short period of time. I became a "skilled" beginner in Latex, MatLab, and many mathematical models overnight, like some of you before the final exam to some degree.

I attached some hopefully useful materials in this repository, which are referred by our team last year. The template is exactly the one we used then. Thanks again for my teammates! Almost all of these materials are found by them with great efforts. Please contact me to delete them if it offends your interest.

For further questions, please post them in the "Issues" above. I will try my best to answer them.

Wish you good luck with MCM/ICM 2019!
